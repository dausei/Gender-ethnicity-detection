# Facial Authentication Model

## Introduction:
Facial authentication based on gender and ethnicity classification has gained significant attention due to its wide-ranging applications in security, healthcare, and marketing. In this project, we developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify gender and ethnicity based on facial images.

## Dataset:
We utilized the UTK dataset, which consists of facial images labeled with age, gender, and ethnicity. The dataset was preprocessed and imported into Google Drive for accessibility.

- **Dataset Link:** [UTK Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nipunarora8/age-gender-and-ethnicity-face-data-csv/data)
- **Google Drive Link:** [Google Drive Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dO2G-VW-6YBIjUEYtyWsF6DB0a-8-LRf?usp=share_link)

## Data Preprocessing:
We loaded the dataset from Google Drive into Google Colab and preprocessed it as follows:

- Converted pixel values to NumPy arrays
- Reshaped images to 48x48x1
- Normalized pixel values to the range [0, 1]

## Model Architecture:
For gender and ethnicity classification, we designed a CNN comprising several key components:

- **Convolutional Layers:** Extract essential features and patterns from input images.
- **Max-Pooling Layers:** Downsample feature maps to enhance model efficiency.
- **Flattening Layer:** Transform multi-dimensional feature maps into a flattened vector format.
- **Dense Layers:** Perform high-level abstraction and classification.
- **Dropout Regularization:** Mitigate overfitting and enhance model generalization.

## Training:
The model was trained using Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss functions for both gender and ethnicity classification.

- **Training Parameters:**
  - Epochs: 40
  - Batch Size: 64

## Results:
### Model Performance:
The model achieved the following performance metrics on the validation set:

- Gender Accuracy: [Insert Gender Accuracy]
- Ethnicity Accuracy: [Insert Ethnicity Accuracy]

### Training Visualization:
Visualizations of training and validation accuracy for gender and ethnicity classification are provided.

## Discussion:
### Critical Review of Results:
While the model achieved satisfactory accuracy, there are limitations and areas for improvement. Image quality, dataset diversity, and biases may affect performance.

### Next Steps:
To enhance performance, we propose data augmentation, model optimization, and bias mitigation techniques.

## Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the feasibility of using machine learning for facial authentication. Further improvements are needed to enhance model performance and address biases.
